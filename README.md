### The Problem
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.
The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
 - Each session contains multiple talks.
 - Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
 - Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
 - The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
 - No talk title has numbers in it.
 - All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
 - Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

### How to Run
  1. Download the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    - You can follow directions here if you want to [install Node via Homebrew](https://changelog.com/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x/).
  1. Save your .txt file in the same folder as the rest of the submitted files.
    - There is already a talks.txt file in there, with the given test input.
  1. Open Terminal.
  1. Run `node conference-track.js [fileName].txt`
  1. The output will show you the schedule.
